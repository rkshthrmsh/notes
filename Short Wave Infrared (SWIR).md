# Short Wave Infrared (SWIR)
SWIR refers to light falling in the range of between 900--1700 nm. Beyond this typical range, SWIR has a few extensions. eSWIR or Extended SWIR defines wavelengths that go beyond 1700 nm to cover the range between 900--2500 nm; whereas vSWIR or Visible SWIR covers the range between 400--1700 nm[[Imaging Systems#^Ref-1|[1]]].

The main sensors used in SWIR [[Hyperspectral Imaging|hyperspectral imaging]] are [[Indium Gallium Arsenide Sensors#Indium Gallium Arsenide Sensors|indium gallium arsenide]] (InGaAs) sensors, which cover the typical SWIR range, extending from as little as 550 nm to as much as 2.5 m in wavelength. Silicon sensors have an upper limit of approximately 1000 nm and therefore cannot be used for SWIR imaging.

## SWIR Application
### Agriculture
Wavelengths of 1450 nm correspond to water absorption. A narrow bandpass filter around this wavelength can enhance the effect of water absorption imaging. #FIXME/need-info
