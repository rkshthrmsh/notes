# Hyperspectral Imaging
Hyperspectral imaging is a combination of traditional spectroscopy technology and the modern imaging system. A hyperspectral imager captures each pixel in a scene across multiple bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.

Depending on the part of the electromagnetic spectrum being imaged, different kinds of sensors will need to be used. The chemistry of the sensor determines the range of wavelengths accessible to imaging.
