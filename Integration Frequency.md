# Integration Frequency
#git 

The frequency at which code is pushed in to the remote repository determines the efficiency of resolving conflicts, the complexity of each merge, and the risks associated with them. High frequency integration, in general, is advantageous. Although it increases the frequency of merging, the size of each merge is usually small which reduces complexity, risk, and helps identify conflicts earlier in the development process. Refactoring is also much simpler with a higher frequency of integration since it can be done regularly with little friction.
