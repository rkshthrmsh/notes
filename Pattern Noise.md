# Pattern Noise
#sensor-noise 
Pattern noise is the background pattern of hot (bright) and cold (dark) pixels on an image that is caused by the small variations in the responsivity of individual pixels on the sensor. These variations result from differences in offset (bias) value between pixel (columns).
