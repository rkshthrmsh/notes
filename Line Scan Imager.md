# Line Scan Imager
A line scan imager is an imaging system that uses a single sensor element to produce a two-dimensional image[[Line Scan Imager#^Ref-1|[1]]]. Two-dimensional images are generated by acquiring successive line-scans while the object moves perpendicular to the line of pixels in the sensor.

## Advantages
Line scan imagers provide many benefits:
- They are cost-effective implementation for high spatial resolution image capture, i.e., price/pixel is low
- High [[Band Gap#Dynamic range|dynamic range]]
- high pixel [[Band Gap#Pixel Fill Factor|fill-factor]] (typically 100%) to maximize sensitivity
- Smear-free images
- Processing efficiency is improved since line scanning eliminates frame overlaps required to build a seamless image

## Tradeoffs
In line-scan imaging, the tradeoffs are usually related to lighting and optics. Illumination must remain reasonably steady throughout the filed of view. An in-camera flat-field correction, available in some cameras, can compensate for poor uniformity. Integration periods for line-scan imaging are typically very short. Therefore, the illumination intensity needs to be high. High sensitivity TDI line scan available in some cameras address this problem. "*Optical demands center around the typically large image circle diameter required for line-scan imagers because of their high resolution, and the minor aberrations inherent in spherical optics.*"
