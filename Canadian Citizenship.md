# Canadian Citizenship
## Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship
- Canadian law originates from several sources. These include laws passed by the Parliament and provincial legislatures, English common law, the civil code of France, and the unwritten constitution inherited from Great Britain.
- Together these sources secure many freedoms for Canadians, such as:
	- Freedom of conscience and religion
	- Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression. This also includes the freedom of speech and of the press.
	- Freedom of peaceful assembly.
	- Freedom of association.

- The Constitution of Canada was amended in 1983 to entrench the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*. The charter sets out additional rights, such as:
	- Mobility Rights
	- Aboriginal Peoples' Rights
	- Official Language Rights and Minority Language Educational Rights
	- Multiculturalism

- Rights come with responsibilities. These include:
	- Obeying the law
	- Taking responsibility for oneself and one's family
	- Serving on a jury
	- Voting in elections
	- Helping others in the community
	- Protecting and enjoying our environment and heritage

## Who We Are
- Canada is the only constitutional monarchy in North America.
- Canadian institutions hold up a commitment to *Peace, Order, and Good Government* as stated in the original constitution document in 1867, the *British North America Act*.
- Canada's three founding peoples are Aboriginals, French, and British.
### Aboriginal Peoples
- Aboriginal people are believed to have migrated into Canada from Asia thousands of years ago. Their cultures are rooted in religious beliefs about their relationship to the Creator, the natural environment and each other.
- Aboriginal and treaty rights are entrenched in the Canadian Constitution.
- The term Aboriginal peoples refers to three distinct groups:
	- The **Metis** are a distinct people of mixed Aboriginal and European ancestry. The majority of them live in the Prairie provinces. They come from both French- and English-speaking backgrounds, and speak their own dialect, Michif.
	- The **Inuit** (meaning  "the people" in Inuktitut) live in small, scattered communities across the Arctic. 
	- **First Nations** refers to the Aboriginal people who are not Inuit or Metis. About half of them live on reserve land in ~600 communities while the other half live mainly in urban centres.
- About 65% of the Aboriginal people are First Nations, while 30% are Metis, and 4% Inuit.
### English and French
- As of the writing of the reference, there are 18 million Anglophones and 7 million Francophones. 
- The **Acadians** are descendants of French colonists who began settling in what are now the Maritime provinces in 1604.
- The great majority of Canadians identify as Christians. The largest religious affiliation is Catholic followed by various Protestant churches.
## Canada's History
### Aboriginal Peoples
- When Europeans started exploring Canada, they found all regions occupied by native peoples. Among these Aboriginal people, 
	- The Huron-Wendat of the Great Lakes region, like the Iroquois, were farmers and hunters.
	- The Cree and Dene of the Northwest were hunter-gatherers.
	- The Sioux were nomadic, following the bison herd.
	- The Inuit lived off Arctic wildlife.
	- West Coast natives preserved fish by drying and smoking.
## The First Europeans
- 1000 years ago: Vikings from Iceland were the first colonizers and reached Labrador and Newfoundland.
-  1497: European exploration began with the expedition of John Cabot, who was the first to draw a map of Canada's east coast.
- 1534–1542: Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic and claimed Canada for King Francis I of France.
- 1604: French explorers Pierre de Monts and Samuel de Champlain established the first European settlement in Canada at Port-Royal, in Acadia (present-day Nova Scotia). Through extensive fur trade and alignment with First Nations, French leaders like Jean Talon, Bishop Laval, and Count Frontenac built a French empire that reached from the Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico.
- 1670: King Charles II of England granted the Hudson's Bay Company exclusive trading rights over the watershed draining into Hudson Bay.
- 1759: British defeated the French in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec City. This marked the end of France's empire in America.
- 1774: British Parliament passed the *Quebec Act* to govern the French Roman Catholic majority. It allowed religious freedom for Catholics and permitted them to hold public office.
- 1776: 13 British colonies to the south of Quebec declared independence to form the United States. Many Loyalists fled the oppression of the American Revolution to settle in Nova Scotia and Quebec.

- 1807: British Parliament prohibited the buying and selling of slaves.
- 1812: The War of 1812 saw a failed attempt by the United States to conquer Canada. Canadian volunteers and First Nations joined the British forces in defending Canada against the United States. The present-day US and Canada border is partly an outcome of the War of 1812.
- 1833: British Parliament abolished slavery altogether throughout the Empire.
- 1837–38: Armed rebellions occurred in areas outside Montreal and Toronto by reformers who believed that progress towards democracy was very slow. They were defeated by the British troops and Canadian volunteers. Lord Durham recommended that Upper and Lower Canada be merged together and given *responsible government*—which meant that the Crown must have the support of a majority of elected representatives in order to govern.
- 1840: Upper and Lower Canada were united as the Province of Canada. Reformers such as Sir Louis-Hippolyte La Fontaine, Robert Baldwin, and Joseph Howe worked with British governors towards responsible government.
