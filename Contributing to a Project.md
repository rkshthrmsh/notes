# Contributing to a Project
#git 

The method for contributing to a project depends on the number of active contributors, Git workflow, developers' commit access, and external contribution methods.
- The size of the active contributor team determines the merge complexity and code consistency.
- The workflow determines the process for merging the developers' code into the "main" project branch--whether they do it directly or through a lieutenant--and also the code review process.
- The commit access and frequency are also important variables. Whether developers have write access to the central repository, or accepted methodology for pushing changes determine the process of contributing to a project.
