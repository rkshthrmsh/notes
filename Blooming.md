# Blooming
At [[Pixel Saturation|saturation]], any additional charge to pixels may spread into neighboring pixels. This phenomenon is called blooming and is visualized as a white streak or blob in the image.

Antiblooming structures can be incorporated into the sensor design to reverse these effects. The most common types are fixed and gated. Fixed antiblooming structures include a drain that runs next to the pixel with a barrier between pixel and drain. When the charge overflows, it will flow into the drain instead of neighboring pixels. In gated antiblooming structures a gate system controls the opening or closing of a barrier. If open, the gate allows additional charge in the pixel to flow into the drain.
