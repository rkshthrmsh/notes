# NP-Completeness
NP-Complete is short for Nondeterministic Polynomial-Time Complete. A decision problem $C$ is NP-complete if:
1. $C$ is in [[NP]]
2. $C$ is [[NP-Hard]], i.e., Every problem in NP is reducible to $C$ in polynomial time.

A consequence of this definition is that if we had a polynomial time algorithm forÂ $C$, we could solve all problems in NP in polynomial time.
