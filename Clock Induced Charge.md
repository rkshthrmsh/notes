# Clock Induced Charge
#sensor-noise 
Clock induced charge (CIC), also known as spurious charge, is generated by the transfer of charge through the device. As the charge is being transferred, there is a small probability of ionization that will occur adding further unwanted charge. CIC is usually less significant that dark noise and readout noise and can be corrected through the use of a spurious noise filter which identifies the affected pixels and replaces their signal value with the mean value of the neighboring pixels.
