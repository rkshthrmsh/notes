# Digital Filter
Digital filters perform mathematical operations on sampled, discrete time signals to reduce or enhance certain aspects of the signal. In contrast, analog filters are electronic circuits that operate on continuous-time analog signals.

Digital filters are usually more expensive than their analog equivalents, but they can be made very high order, and are often [[Finite Impulse Response|finite impulse response]] filters which allow for [[Linear Phase|linear phase]].
