# NP-Hard
**NP-hardness** or  non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness is the defining property of a class of problems that are informally "at least as hard as the hardest problems in [[NP]].

A more precise specification is: a problem _H_ is NP-hard when every problem _L_ in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to _H_; that is, assuming a solution for _H_ takes 1 unit time, _H_'s solution can be used to solve _L_ in polynomial time. As a consequence, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve any NP-hard problem would give polynomial time algorithms for all the problems in NP.
