# Design Creation with RTL
#ultrafastDesign 

During design creation the main points to consider are: 
- Achieving the desired functionality
- Operating at the desired frequency
- Operating with the desired degree of reliability 
- Fitting within the silicon resource and power budget

## [[Defining a Good RTL Design Hierarchy]]

## Working with IP
Planning IP requirements is an important stage in every project. 
- Available IP options must be evaluated against required functionality to determine whether: Custom logic design makes more sense compared to available cores.
- Interface requirements must be evaluated for memories, networks, and peripherals.
- While designing custom IP use the industry-standard IP-XACT format as much as possible to ensure that designs can be shared easily.
