# Pixel Fill Factor
#sensor-characteristics 
Structurally, a pixel is composed of transistors, wires, capacitors, registers, and light sensitive areas. The fill factor is the ratio of light sensitive area versus total area of a pixel. 

Fill factor can usually be improved by adding micro lenses which collect and focus the impinging light onto the light sensitive area of the pixel[1].
