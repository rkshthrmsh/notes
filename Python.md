Python is a full programming language with elegant syntax, dynamic typing, and an interpreter which make it ideal for scripting and rapid application development. The interpreter is freely available and the language is supported by a plethora of open-source libraries which make it attractive to many programmers. Moreover, Python provides a very high level of abstraction with flexible data structures while still being easy to use.

The Python interpreter saves a considerable amount of development time because compilation and linking is not necessary. Acting as a handy desk calculator, the interpreter can be used to run simple experiments easily.

In Python, programs can be split into small reusable modules. In fact, Python has many built-in modules which provide many of the essential features such as file IO, sockets, system calls, etc. 

Programs written in Python are compact and readable; and typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs. This is because:
- complex operations can be expressed in a single statement using the high-level data types
- Python uses indentation to group statements instead of opening and closing brackets
- variable and are argument declarations are not necessary

Finally, Python is extensible. Adding new functions and modules for performing critical operations or achieving max speeds is easy.

## Numbers
- There is full support for floating point numbers. Expressions with mixed (int and float) operands convert operands to float.
- In interactive mode, the last printed value is assigned to the variable `_`. This allows quick reuse of the previous result.

## Strings
- Python strings are immutable--they cannot be changed once created.
- Single line strings need to be enclosed within `""` or `''`. 
- Multi-line strings need to be enclosed within `"""..."""` or `'''...'''`.
- Strings can be indexed into or sliced.

## Lists
- Lists are mutable data structures.
- Lists are possibly the most versatile data type in Python. They can contain items of heterogenous types, but are commonly used for homogenous collections.
