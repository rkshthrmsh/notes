# Quantum Efficiency
#sensor-characteristics
The quantum efficiency of a sensor is defined as the number of electron-hole pairs created and successfully read out for each incoming photon. When the energy of an incoming photon is greater than the [[Band Gap|band gap]] energy, an electron in the valence band has a high probability of being excited into the conduction band therefore creating an electron-hole pair for conducting electricity. This phenomenon is known as the *photoelectric effect* and is dependent on the wavelength of incoming light. Semiconductors will only detect photons if they have a shorter wavelength (or higher energy) than the band gap of the material.

The amount of electronic charge generated by a quanta of light energy is determined by a number of factors such as absorption coefficient, photon recombination lifetime, diffusion length, and the properties of the composite sensor surface. The absorption coefficient is also wavelength dependent, with longer wavelength photons penetrating deeper into the semiconductor substrate than shorter wavelengths.

Quantum Efficiency is a property of the sensor's photovoltaic response and is important for low-light imaging applications.
