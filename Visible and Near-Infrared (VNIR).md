# Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR)
VNIR refers to the wavelengths between ~400 - 1100 nm in the electromagnetic spectrum. These wavelengths cover the visible spectrum with an adjacent portion of the infrared spectrum.

Various sensor technologies including [[Charge-Coupled Device (CCD)]]s and CMOS can be used for VNIR imaging.
