# The Threats to Reliability
## Faults, Errors, and Failures

The relationship between faults, errors, and failures (also called fault pathology) is captured by the following image.

## Faults 
Faults can have multiple, diverse sources. Based on the source or their nature, faults can broadly be classified as:

## Failure Modes
A system can have multiple failure modes, i.e., it can fail in multiple ways. A system can be thought of as a set of interacting components. A fault causes an error in the state of one (or more) of the components. However, system failure occurs only when the error reaches the service interface. Failure modes can be classified as shown in the image below.
