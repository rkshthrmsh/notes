# NP
According to computational complexity theory, NP or nondeterministic polynomial time is a complexity class comprising the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is "yes", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a [[Turing Machine|deterministic Turing machine]] or alternatively **the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a [[Nondeterministic Turing Machine]].**
