# Distributed Computing

A distributed computing system is one in which multiple processors are involved in the execution of a computation or control problem. When the processors are remotely located from each other, the system is said to execute *physically distributed computing* [1].

*Cooperative distributed computing* is an advanced form of computing that involves collaboration among processors, with each processor solving a part of a larger problem [1].
