# Readout Noise
#sensor-noise 
The noise generated by the electronics of the camera when the charge stored within the pixels is read out is called the Readout Noise. Readout noise is an accumulation of all the noise generated by each system component required to convert the charge of each pixel into a signal. The lower the read noise, the easier it is to detect weak signals thereby allowing for higher [[Dynamic Range|dynamic range]].
