# Linearity
#sensor-characteristics 
A sensor is said to exhibit linear response if the photoelectric conversion between number of photons to number of electrons are linearly related. For example, if a CCD detects 100 photons and converts them to 100 electrons assuming 100% [[Quantum Efficiency]] it has linearity. Linearity is useful as there is no need for additional processing on the image to determine the real or true intensity of different objects in an image.
