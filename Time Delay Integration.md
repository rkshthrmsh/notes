# Time Delay Integration (TDI)
Time delay integration is a readout mode based on the accumulation of exposures of the same object as it moves linearly under the imaging sensor. Essentially, such a readout mode synchronizes the transfer of charges from one imaging line to the next with the same speed as the object moving under the camera. As a result, each line images the (exact) same object and leading to a cumulative signal. This allows the detection of very weak signals and improves the SNR.
