# Photon Shot Noise
#sensor-noise 
Photon noise shot is the only noise type that cannot be controlled. The noise source is due to natural photon fluctuation and follows a Poisson behavior. 
$$ Photon\;Shot\;Noise = \sqrt{Signal}$$
Although it grows with the signal, it is more significant at low signal applications.

When the photon shot noise exceeds the read noise, the data is said to be photon shot noise limited
