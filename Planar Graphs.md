## Planar Graphs
#graphTheory 

- A graph is said to be *planar* if it can be drawn in the plane such that its edges do not meet (cross) except at their end points.
- Geographical maps are always equivalent to planar graphs.

### Euler's Formula
**Let $G$ be a connected planar graph, then** $$v - e + f = 2$$ Where, $v$ is the number of vertices, $e$ is the number of edges, and $f$ is the number of faces in the drawing of $G$.
