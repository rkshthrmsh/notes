# Conjunctive Normal Form
In Boolean logic, the conjunctive normal form or CNF is the expression of a formula as a conjunction of one or more clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals. It is equivalent to the product of sums or AND of ORs.

## Examples
1. $(A \wedge B) \vee C$  is equivalent to $(A \vee C) \wedge (B \vee C)$ in CNF
2. $A \wedge (B \vee (D \wedge E))$ is equivalent to $(A) \wedge (B \vee D) \wedge (B \vee E)$ in CNF
