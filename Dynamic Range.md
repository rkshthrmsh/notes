# Dynamic Range
#sensor-characteristics 
The dynamic range of a sensor determines the brightest and darkest areas of an object that can be captured in a single image and still be read. It quantifies the working range of a sensor within which usable data can be extracted. Mathematically, it is defined as the logarithmic ratio between the sensor's [[Full Well Capacity|full well capacity]] and its noise floor.

$$Dynamic Range = 20log(\frac{full~well~capacity}{noise~floor})$$
Large dynamic ranges are preferable because it allows high [[Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)|SNR]].
