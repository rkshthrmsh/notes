#ultrafastDesign 

Well designed RTL code can lead to significant improvements in frequency and power consumption. The following are a set of guidelines to assess and improve the device performance.

### [[Control Signals and Control Sets]]

### [[Know What You Infer]]

### [[Coding Styles to Improve Maximum Frequency]]

### [[Coding Styles to Improve Power]]

### [[Performance Power Trade-Off for BRAMs]]

### Running RTL DRCs
The supporting Design Rule Checks (DRCs) to identify potential issues with HDL code should be run frequently to mitigate issues early in the development process.
