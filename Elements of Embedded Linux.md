# Elements of Embedded Linux
## The four elements of embedded Linux
- Toolchain: The compiler and other tools needed to create code for a target device.
- Bootloader: The program that initializes the board and loads the Linux kernel.
- Kernel: Heart of the Linux OS that manages system resources and interfacing with hardware.
- Root filesystem: Filesystem with libraries and programs that are run once the kernel has completed initialization.

A fifth element worth mentioning here is the collection of programs specific to the embedded application.
