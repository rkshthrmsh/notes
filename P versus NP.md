# P versus NP

- The P versus NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time ([[NP]]) can also be solved in polynomial time ([[P]]).
- It is a major unsolved problem in theoretical computer science, even being called the most important open problem.
- It is widely believed that $P \neq NP$, which implies that there are problems in NP that are harder to compute than to verify.

- [[NP-Complete|NP-completeness]] is very useful in approaching the $P \stackrel{?}{=} NP$ problem. Since, by definition, any instance of any NP problem can be transformed into an instance of an NP-complete problem, showing that any NP-complete problem is in P would prove that $P = NP$.
