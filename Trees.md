## Trees
#graphTheory 

Trees are defined by the following equivalent definitions:
- A *Tree* is a connected graph without cycles. 
- It is a connected graph on n vertices with n - 1 edges.
- A graph is a tree iff there is a unique simple path between any pair of its vertices.

- A path graph is always a tree.

- A *spanning tree* of a graph $G$, is a subgraph of $G$ which is a tree containing all vertices of $G$.
- A *minimum spanning tree* of a weighted graph $G$ is a spanning tree of the smallest weight. The problem of finding a minimum spanning tree has implications for optimizing network connectivity.
