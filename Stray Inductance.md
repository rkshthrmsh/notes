# Stray Inductance
Stray [[Inductance|inductance]] is unwanted inductance in a circuit caused due to the magnetic field created by the current flowing through long component leads. This is also known as lead inductance or parasitic inductance and can disrupt "normal" (expected) current flow in a circuit [1]. 

In capacitors, especially, the presence of long leads generates an inductive effect which presents high impedance to the flow of high-frequency currents. Since the primary application of capacitors is predicated on their ability to provide low-impedance paths for high-frequency currents, the inductive effect of long leads negate their ability.
$$ Z = j(-\frac{1}{\omega C} + \omega L)$$
where $\omega=2\pi f$, $C$ and $L$ are the capacitance and inductance respectively. As can be noted here, the impedance from the inductor opposes that of the capacitor and the situation becomes exacerbated at higher frequencies.
