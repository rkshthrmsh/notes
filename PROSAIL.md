# PROSAIL

The combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL, has been used for about sixteen years to study plant canopy spectral and directional reflectance in the solar domain. PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years.

# Radiative Transfer Model

Radiative transfer is the physical phenomenon of energy transfer in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The propagation of radiation through a medium is affected by absorption, emission, and scattering processes. The equation of radiative transfer describes these interactions mathematically. Equations of radiative transfer have application in a wide variety of subjects including optics, astrophysics, atmospheric science, and remote sensing. Analytic solutions to the radiative transfer equation (RTE) exist for simple cases but for more realistic media, with complex multiple scattering effects, numerical methods are required.

## Vegetation RTM
There are different vegetation RTMs and are broadly classified into Leaf RTMs and Canopy RTMs. 

### Leaf RTMs 

Leaf optical models simulate the radiative transfer interactions of light and leaf biochemical properties. These models allow retrieving leaf biochemical composition and structural characteristics. 

### Canopy RTM

Canopy optical models simulate the radiative transfer interactions of light and canopy structural properties. These models allow retrieving canopy structural characteristics. When coupled with leaf optical models, these models also allow the retrieval of leaf attributes at the canopy scale.
