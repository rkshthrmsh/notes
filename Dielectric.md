# Dielectric

Dielectric is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by applying an electric field [1]. They lack loosely bound electrons, as a result of which no charge flows through the dielectric when placed in an electric field. Instead the bound positive charges shift slightly to in the direction of the electric field and the negative charges shift in the opposite direction leading to *dielectric polarization*. This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric.
