# Pixel Saturation
Saturation is a phenomenon which occurs when an individual pixel is unable to store any more charge. Saturation occurs when the electron well of each pixel is full. 

The maximum charge that can be stored within a pixel is largely determined by its area, however as the charge accumulates in a potential well, the probability of trapping an electron reduces as it approaches saturation. As the pixel approaches saturation limit, the linear relationship between light intensity and signal degrades.
